# Open Meal

The goal for Open Meal is to facilitate a way for municipalities and organisations to openly share menus from their meal distributors (schools, retirement homes and more). Data is shared through [providers](/docs/providers) and can be consumed by third-party developers to build custom applications on top of it.

1.

## Consuming the API
